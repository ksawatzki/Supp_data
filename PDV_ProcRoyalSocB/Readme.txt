Description of data

Alignments directory includes all sequences used in the manuscript and supplement, aligned and in FASTA format that were read into BEAST and RAxML for phylogenetic analysis. 
  PDV sequences are in nucleotide format. Nectin-4 and SLAM are amino acid.
  GenBank accession numbers are as follows: Full genome - MW642077 (US/Hg/IFAW18-001/2018), MW642078 (US/Pv/NEAQ18-044/2018), MW504062 (CA/Pg/WVL181140/2017), MW581015 (US/Pv/MME-287/2018), MW581016 (US/Pv/MME-343/2018), MW581017 (US/Pv/MME-430/2018); Hemagglutinin - MW581018- MW581026
  Nectin-4 and SLAM Refseq accessions are included in a tab-delimited text file in their directory  

BEAST directory includes the following input and output files from BEAST runs for PDV full length, partial genome and HA gene analyses:
  BEAUTi-generated input file with all run parameters and metadata
  BEAST-generated log file output
